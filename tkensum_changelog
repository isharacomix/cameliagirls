version dev_2011-07-19

This is my current version above dev_2011-06-20

changes from 2011-06-20 to 2011-07-09:

    * the "act_1 ..." screen now based on Text, not an image any more
    * special screens, which indicates the chapter or place received good looking effects
    * Save/load menu were merged again and it received some functional and good looking improvements
    * improvements on button look
    * add a click-to-continue arrow
    * 'Auto mode' and 'Skip mode' were taken out for now
    * add ability to choose theme (but needs restart)
    * improvements in configuration menu like dividing settings into different areas (Game, Video, Sound, Theme)
    * add an android text file (now you can play CG on smartphone, works fine, except it doesn't know special effect commands yet)
    * many little bug fixes and code improvements

You just have to replace all the files you can find in this archive, or add the necessary files from the dev_2011-06-20 release.
